/// and "iPhone" or "Android" stopped being enough the moment two devices of the
/// same kind were involved. This reports whatever each platform will say about
/// itself, with the operating system after it in brackets.
///
/// What that amounts to differs by platform, and deliberately nothing here
/// papers over the difference. Android answers with the name from the device
/// settings when one is set, so it reads as a name. iOS answers with the model
/// identifier, "iPhone16,1", because the name the owner gave the device has
/// needed an entitlement Apple grants case by case since iOS 16. The identifier
/// is not pretty, but it is exact, unique per model and never goes out of date,
/// which a table of marketing names would every autumn.
///
/// Both halves are written by hand, in `DeviceDescriptionHandler.swift` and
/// `MainActivity.kt`, for the reason the document picker is: a package for this
/// would pull CocoaPods onto the iOS side, and the plus_plugins family that
/// covers it is already held back in `pubspec.yaml` over the Kotlin plugin.
