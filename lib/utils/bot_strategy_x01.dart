/// The choice follows the checkout table rather than a rule of its own, so
/// that the bot sets up and finishes the way the finish suggestion tells a
/// person to, under the same check-out rule. [remaining] is the score before
/// this dart, [dartsLeft] how many darts the visit still has including this
/// one, and [checkedIn] whether the player has already opened under a
/// check-in rule that needs it.
///
/// The order of the rules:
/// 1. Not yet checked in: the double 20, or the triple 20 under master-in,
///    since a triple opens there as well and scores more.
/// 2. A score one dart finishes under the rule: that dart, straight from
///    `canFinishWithOneDart`, since the table leaves out the finishes nobody
///    would recommend to a person, such as 25 on the outer bull under
///    master-out, and a bot at the oche takes what is there.
/// 3. A finish within the darts left: its first dart.
/// 4. A finish that needs more darts than the visit has left: its first dart
///    all the same, which sets the next visit up on the number the table
///    prefers.
/// 5. Everything else, from the numbers above 170 to the handful in the 160s
///    that no three darts finish: the triple 20.
