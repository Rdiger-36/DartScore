///    has open: score there, on the highest such field. Behind means fewer
///    points in normal Cricket and more in cut-throat, where points are the
///    thing to avoid. Simple scoring has no points, so this never applies.
/// 2. A field of its own still open: close it, the highest first.
/// 3. Everything closed but not ahead: the only move left is to score, on
///    the highest field an opponent has open.
/// 4. Nothing open anywhere: the bull, for want of a better target.
///
/// A number is aimed at its triple by a bot that [aimTriples], at the fat
/// single otherwise; under simple scoring every hit is one mark, so the
/// single is always the target. The bull is always aimed at its centre.
