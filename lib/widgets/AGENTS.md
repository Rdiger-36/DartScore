# Widgets

The building blocks the screens are assembled from. Owns rendering and local UI interaction. Owns no app state, no database access and no statistics formula.

## Entry Points

### Input and dartboard

- `dartboard_input.dart`, dartboard-style tap input
- `dartboard_icon.dart`, decorative dartboard SVG widget
- `dartboard_target_painter.dart`, paints a dartboard with a target segment highlighted
- `cricket_marks_widget.dart`, renders Cricket marks (slash / X / circle-X) for a field
- `finish_suggestion_widget.dart`, checkout hint display
- `favorite_double_picker.dart`, picks a player's favorite doubles

### Shared setup blocks, used by every mode

- `team_section.dart`, team naming, add/remove and assignment
- `starting_order_section.dart`, random vs. fixed plus the drag-to-sort list
- `player_select_section.dart`, the roster with a checkbox each, the add button and the star on the main profile

### Shared result rendering

- `game_info_card.dart`, the card listing a finished game's settings
- `summary_body.dart`, the body every summary and history detail is laid into, one column or two
- `summary_player_card.dart`, the player/team stat card for the X01 summary and history screens
- `final_ranking_card.dart`, the placement-mode ranking card and per-leg table
- `stat_row.dart`, the label/value row used by every stat list
- `throw_row.dart`, one recorded visit as a list entry, shared by the throw log and the lifetime recent-throws list
- `throw_log_card.dart`, the "All Throws" log for the X01 summary and history screens
- `rematch_button.dart`, "Play Again" plus its confirmation dialog

### Transfers and players

- `wifi_pairing.dart`, the QR scanner, the pairing number dialog, the QR card, the route selector and the one mapping from a start failure to what it says on screen, all shared by sync and backup
- `player_dialog.dart`, create/edit player dialog

## Contracts and Invariants

- A widget never holds mutable app state and never touches SQLite. It takes what it renders as a parameter or reads a provider
- The shared result widgets are shared on purpose: the X01 summary and the X01 history detail render the same result through `SummaryPlayerCard`, `FinalRankingCard` and `ThrowLogCard`. Fix the widget, not one of the two screens
- A recorded visit is rendered by `ThrowRow` wherever it appears, the throw log of a game and the lifetime recent-throws list alike. It fills four slots over two lines and decides from its parameters which of them a caller has anything to put in; a list that needs a fifth thing belongs in the widget, not in a copy of it
- `GameInfoCard` takes `dense: true` from the four history detail screens and the default from the four post-game summaries. That split is a convention across both sets, not a per-mode oversight
- Colors come from `ThemeProvider`, team accents from `utils/team_color.dart`, double and triple affordances from `utils/segment_color.dart`
- Two panes side by side are built with `SidePaneLayout` from `utils/layout.dart`, never with a hand rolled `Row`. It is what carries the minimum pane width and the input side, and a second layout would answer both differently
- `SummaryBody` divides all eight summary and history detail screens. Its divider stands in the middle and stays there, because both columns hold cards of the same kind; only the game, the history and the player list have anything to rebalance, and only those three let it be dragged
- Strings come from `AppLocalizations`, and the per-mode setting names from `utils/game_labels.dart`

## Patterns

A block that a second game mode is about to need belongs here, parameterised, rather than copied into the second setup screen. `TeamSection` and `StartingOrderSection` are what that looks like when it is done.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not compute stats in a widget. `ThrowStats` is the one aggregation
- Do not hardcode a color that should follow the theme
- Do not copy `wifi_pairing.dart` for a third transfer flow; both sync and backup already share it
- `TransferRouteSelector` hides the own-network row rather than disabling it when the device cannot raise one. An option that can never be picked here is not a choice, and explaining why would say more about Android versions than anyone wants to read while sending a profile
- `transferStartMessage` is the one place a transfer failure becomes a sentence. A second copy is how the two screens would start telling the user different things about the same fault
- Do not build a second player roster into a setup screen. `PlayerSelectSection` is the one, and it takes the order `PlayersProvider` hands it: main profile first, everyone else alphabetically
